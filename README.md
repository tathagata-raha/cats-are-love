# Cats are Love! üê±

Hello hooman! Welcome to my super-furry corner of the internet, the official submission for the **Streamlit Connections Hackathon**! 

"Cats are Love!" is a cute web application built with purr-thon and Streamlit. It uses the [Cats-as-a-Service(CATAAS) API](https://cataas.com/) to fetch adorable cat pictures based on the tags or even random cat images. Wait, there's more! It can make the cat image say anything you want. Yes, we cats can talk here!

*Did you know? A cat's brain is 90% similar to a human's brain. Cats and humans have nearly identical sections of the brain that control emotions. So, next time you see your furry friend, remember they understand you purr-fectly well. After all, cats are love! üò∫üíï*
