# Cats are Love! 🐱💖

Hello hooman! Welcome to my super-furry corner of the internet, the official submission for the **Streamlit Connections Hackathon**! 

"Cats are Love!" is a cute web application built with lots of purr-thon (Python) love and some magical Streamlit dust. It uses the [Cats-as-a-Service(CATAAS) API](https://cataas.com/) to fetch purrfect catto pictures based on the tags or even random cat images. Wait, there's more! It can make the cat image say anything you want. Yes, we cats can tawk here!

*Did you know? A cat's brain is 90% similar to a human's brain. Cats and humans have nearly identical sections of the brain that control emotions. So, next time you see your furry friend, remember they understand you purr-fectly well. After all, cats are love! 😺💕*
