# Cats are Love! üê±

This is the official submission for the **Streamlit Connections Hackathon**. 

"Cats are Love!" is a web application built using Python and Streamlit. It uses the [Cats-as-a-Service(CATAAS) API](https://cataas.com/) to find cat pictures based on the tags or random cat images. Not just that, it can even make the cat image say something!
